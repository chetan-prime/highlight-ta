        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Highlight-Ta is a powerful closure function with two duties: to highlight selected text inside a textarea and to automatically resize a textarea while following CSS declarations and responsive media queries. You can highlight with multiple strings, regexes, classes and custom functions. It's built to help developers create better web applications. Highlight-Ta is a stand-alone script and does not rely on jQuery or third party libraries.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="segment">
        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>In an attempt to stay framework agnostic, please do two things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a div or section containing a textarea.</li>
          <pre><code>&ltdiv id="cntr-div"&gt
  &lttextarea id="hlght-ta"&gt
  &lt/textarea&gt
&lt/div&gt</code></pre>

          <li>Provide an object of regexes, strings, or functions matching the following patterns:</li>
          <pre><code>// an object of objects containing a "pattern" key with a string.

var patterns = {
  "pattern1": {"pattern": "Hello, world!"},
  "pattern2": {"pattern": "Goodbye, universe!"}
}</code></pre>
        </ul>

        <h3>Install Highlight-Ta:</h3>
        <p>Add <code>highlight-ta.js</code> to your resources or install via npm.</p>
        <pre><code>npm install highlight-ta</code></pre>
        <h3>Create your patterns:</h3>
        <p>With Highlight-Ta, you use regexes, strings and even create custom functions to highlight your text. This is the most important part and Highlight-Ta's most powerful feature. By default, Highlight-Ta will follow your default "mark" CSS declarations. Otherwise you can provide your own.</p>
        <pre><code>// an object of objects containing a "pattern" key with a string.

var patterns = {
  "myPattern1": {"pattern": "Hello, world!"},
  "myPattern2": {"pattern": "Goodbye, universe!"}
}


// an object of objects containing a "pattern" key with a string
// and corresponding "css" keys

var patterns = {
  "pattern1": {"pattern": "Hello, world!",
               "css": "hello-class"},
  "pattern2": {"pattern": "Goodbye, universe!",
               "class": "goodbye-class"}
}


// an object of objects containing a "pattern" of regexes
// and corresponding "css" keys

var reg0 = new RegExp("[A-Z][a-z]*", "g");
var reg1 = new RegExp("", "g")

var patterns = {
  "pattern1": {"pattern": reg0,
               "css": "hello-class"},
  "pattern2": {"pattern": reg1,
               "css": "goodbye-class"}
}
</code></pre>

        <p>If you'd like to make custom functions for more complicated interactions, carefully use the following pattern.</p>
        <code><pre>// don't use the "pattern" or "css" keys.
// use a "function" key with a function that:
//
//   1) takes a string as an argument.
//   3) replaces text with &ltmark&gt attributes.
//   2) returns a string as an argument.


var patterns = {
  "myPattern1": {"function": function(t) {
    var m = "&ltmark id='some-id' style='some-class'&gt$&amp&ltmark&gt";
    t = t.replace(new Regex("[a-z]*", "g"), <);

    return t;
    }
  },
  "myPattern2": {"function": function(t) {
    var m = "&ltmark id='dif-id' style='diff-class'&gt$&amp&ltmark&gt";
    t = t.replace(new Regex("[a-z]*", "g"), <);

    return t;
  }
}
</code></pre>

        <p>If you're worried about order of execution, Highlight-Ta executes each pattern you make based on the alphabetical order of the keys:</p>
        <code><pre>// original order of keys:

var patterns = {
  "pattern2": {"pattern": "Hello, world!"},
  "42": {"pattern": "The answer to the question."}
  "pattern1": {"pattern": "Goodbye, universe!"},
  "coolbeans": {"pattern": "Right on, paragon!"}
}

// order of execution:
"42"
"coolbeans"
"pattern1"
"pattern2"
</code></pre>

        <h3>Instantiate Highlight-Ta:</h3>
        <p>Once you've created your patterns and provided a textarea wrapped in a div, Highlight-Ta handles the rest all on its own.</p>
        <pre><code>// Get parent div, get child textarea, and regex or string

var div = document.getElementById("SomeParentDiv");
var ta = document.getElementById("ChildTextArea");
var reg = new RegExp("[A-Z][a-z]*", "g");
var re = {"myPattern": {"pattern": reg}};


// Instantiate and initialize

var ht = hlghtta(div, ta, re);


// Instantiate and initialize without sharp corners

var ht = hlghtta(div, ta, re, false);


// Initialize or reset highlight-ta with init()

var ht = hlghtta();
ht.init(div, ta, re);
ht.init(div, ta, re, false;
</code></pre>


        <h3>Set Highlight-Ta Patterns:</h3>
        <p>You can set the patterns dynamically with Highlight-Ta. The new patterns will be immediately shown.</p>
        <pre><code>// Make sure you have some patterns or regexes!

ar patterns = {
  "pattern2": {"pattern": "Hello, world!"},
  "42": {"pattern": "The answer to the question."}
  "pattern1": {"pattern": "Goodbye, universe!"},
  "coolbeans": {"pattern": "Right on, paragon!"}
}


// Remove the textarea element and its event listeners

ht.setHighlights(patterns);
</code></pre>

In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.</textarea>

        <h3>Destroy Highlight-Ta:</h3>
        <p>When you destroy Highlight-Ta, it will reset the textarea to its original CSS declarations.</p>
        <pre><code>// Remove the highlighted areas and event listeners
ht.destroy();</code></pre>
        <p>The textarea below has a height of 100px and a max-height of 200px. Destroying it will return the height to 100px. Instantiating it will expand the textarea up to (but not over) 200px.</p>

When girls and men gathered to sit and talk, when the great phonograph played music that throbbed in his stomach and made beautiful and huge pictures from vaguely in his head, Frankie loved it. Then he crouched down in a corner behind a chair where he was hidden and could watch and listen. When there was laughter at a joke he didn’t understand Frankie laughed delightedly behind his chair and when the conversation dealt with abstractions his brows furrowed and he became intent and serious.</textarea>

        <h3>Modify Corners:</h3>
        <p>If an object's border-radius is greater than its border width, the scrollbar will lie over the top and bottom right corners on most browsers. It's not exactly neat. Highlight-ta compensates and squares corners when the scrollbar is present.</p>
        <pre><code>// Turn sharp corners on (default)
ta.setCorners(true);

I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet. </textarea>

        <h3>Updating Content:</h3>
        <p>If the content of the textarea is altered with JavaScript, normal event listeners won't recognize the change. highlight-ta can resize whenever you tell it to resize.</p>
        <pre><code>// Update highlight-ta programmatically
ta.update();

// as in...
var elem = documents.getElementById("my-ta");
var ta = autota(elem);

But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.</textarea>

        <h2>Alternatives</h2>
        <p>Highlight-Ta was built to supply the easiest and most flexible. Existing libraries relied on external libraries and didn't function properly. In fact, here are some of the existing, functioning libraries:</p>
        <p><a href="http://lonekorean.github.io/highlight-within-textarea/">Highlight-Within-Textarea</a> - a similar implementation relying on jQuery.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-highlighttextarea">jQuery-Highlighttextarea</a> - another jQuery implementation.</p>
        <p><a href="http://yavorskiy.github.io/angular-input-highlight/">Angular-Input-Highlight</a> - a directive for Angular.</p>
        <p>By all means, please choose the library that is right for you and your development team. Highlight-Ta is framework agnostic and simple. If there is a feature worth adding or if you find a bug in the script, please post in the repository's <a href="https://github.com/taylor-vann/highlight-ta/issues">issues</a>.</p>
